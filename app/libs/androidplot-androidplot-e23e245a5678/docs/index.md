# Androidplot Documentation
This is the documentation for Androidplot 1.0.  Be aware that many classes have been renamed or removed in this release
to make usage as simple possible.  _**If you are upgrading from a previous release of Androidplot code changes will almost certainly be
necessary.**_

This documentation is limited.  Your best resource
is the [DemoApp's example source code](../demoapp) as it's kept up to date for every release.  If you can't 
find an answer feel free to ask a question on Stack Overflow using the 
[Androidplot tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/androidplot).

If you see something that isn't right or want to contribute, please submit a pull-request - these docs 
live the main repo in the top-level `/docs` directory.

# Tutorials
These tutorials are roughly in the order that they should be read.  Quickstart will get your app 
up and running with a basic xy plot.  Plot Composition explains the common anatomy of all plots
in the Androidplot library and lays the foundation for future topics.  The tutorials discuss 
specific plot types explaining styling and other advanced topics.
